 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
My Beginning in Programming or Development Was With Game Servers Specifically MTA:SA Created Gamemodes and Posting Scripts in Forums and Communities Later I Wanted to Expand to other Games like Samp, Minecraft, FiveM, Roblox.

All of these were a great help since they made it easy for me to learn the languages ​​related to this, time later I expanded to create games in Unity, GameMarker and other game engines. Creation of Applications in Appinventor, Java Netbens Plugins in Eclipse and Configuration of my Own Private Servers (VPS).

Currently I work on a Minecraft Server called ToreMC, some Roblox games Also on Filif Tv+ which is my most promising project in which I invest most of my time
